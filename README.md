# DailyRP_SOURCE_CODE

WARNING: DO NOT USE THE NAME DAILYRP OR THE LOGO AND SELL IT OR PROMOTE IT AS YOUR OWN. ASK FOR PERMISSION FIRST. GRAPHICS ARE THERE AS A REFERENCE AND IDEA. BUT IF I FIND SOMEONE ABUSING THAT I WILL REMOVE THEM. NAME DAILYRP AS WELL AS ALL THE GRAPHICS ARE UNDER MY COPYRIGHT. THANK YOU CONTINUE.

This is the source code for my unreleased server "DailyRP" which I've been working on for many many months with a small team of friends. Life responsibilities took over and I could never finish or start this server. Anyway I figured I just release this source code and let the community enjoy the work or get some ideas about what they might want to potentially use on their server. Side Note: I'm Polish therefore everything is set to Polish and translated to Polish, tho it's a lot of work I usually also translated to English and made many English translations in files - Also made all comments in all scripts in English for ease of sharing.

## FIRSTLY

First thing is first, to clear everything up, majority of the scripts that are in this Source Code are from other author's and repos. Many of them I have absolutely no right over and I am not selling or claiming any copyright, I am simply putting it all in one pack as I've used them and they were used on my server. I will attempt to reference as many sources as I remember but feel free to PR and add your credits if necessary (see bottom of Readme)

## SECONDLY

This upload is very outdated, last time I've worked on FiveM was end of Summer 2018 therefore I am not responsible for any instability caused by the scripts or anything not working as well with current updates. ALSO, I will not be providing any support for anything found in this pack (or very limited see FAQ), I've provided the whole source code I've used and worked with as well as the SQL file for the DB I've used. If there is a file missing or I've forgotten to upload something please put it in help section and I will add it to the repo. Lastly, I have not cleaned up the pack so its a fucking mess like I left it when I stopped working on FiveM. There is a lot of scripts and code that is not even used and its all referenced in server.cfg

## THIRDLY

You should at this point know how to set up a server and how to configure the whole thing so dont ask me for help there are plenty of tutorials online dont be lazy look for one. ALSO Few files are missing because they exceed the maximum size for GitHub those will be listed after Credits :)

# INFO

So with all of that out the way, what is in this pack?

    - The ENTIRE server incl. server files of the version I was using at the time for best compatibility
    - Work that I've found online, FiveM forum, GitHub, and shared with other talented developers over the time I've worked on FiveM
    - My own work
    - Editted Scripts for the purpose of my server
    - The entire SQL file with the whole database I've used and editted for the purposes of my server (obviously empty)
    
Worth mentioning... Not everything is finished, set up or working to it's best ability. As I said in the opening statement I never got the chance to release this server, therefore it's not finished fully. Some things are fully default some are literally just dumped, some are editted fully but not added to any script or hotkey etc. Some is fully finished but not cleaned up or polished. It's more about taking bits together and giving a general idea for others who may want to take some of this and use or simply just get some coding ideas or whatever. Dont expect to just download run and have it over with as it will not work out of the box as it's not fully configured nor set up for plug-n-play. Anyway moving on...
